# Memory Game ðŸ§ 
The goal of the game is to memorize the number of sequence, each round the size of the sequence is incremented by one. The game is over when you get the sequence wrong, 
and you win the game after 50 rounds.

The level of difficulty changes the seconds that the sequence appears on the screen!
